# Reporting the extremely hateful action towards osu! Gacha Club project in the osu! Community

TL, DR: Gacha Life/Gacha Club Community is bad and it affected negatively to my project. osu! community took that and bashed me, insulted me negatively, and this post is for exposing their actions.

## 1. Initial - osu! community and their hate speech (Timeline: 2021 - Project osu! Mg 1.0)
To put it bluntly, I have met a lot of kiddo, they can be good or bad, however, I need to state that using Gacha Club in the osu! game is **completely normal**, and if other people discriminating against a product that you created yourself is completely violating [rule 3 - Community Rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules#community-rules) of the osu! game: "Be good to each other. Harassment or other antagonism has no place within the osu! community. We're here to click circles, beat drums, catch fruit, and hit up to eighteen keys at once, not to be assholes to each other". To put it simple, you drew a very good picture, you love it (as long as it's good in general and no rule violation) but then I insulted you like, "Disgusting picture, this should not be in first place", then you definitely want to punch me in the face, am I right?
In fact, Gacha Life and Gacha Club games are completely fine when used properly, like I use it as a tool to create character that I want, but their communities have affected the image of creators when using this software. And I am one of the victims. When I uploaded the score to the osu! community server, there were very bad responses, as shown below. Don't bring the explaination that, "The Gacha Life community is trash so you are also cringe too, no more no less than them" If you want to curse, curse the cringe creators and community, not this project. The mindset that, "This guy uses Gacha Life? 99% cringe" is not okay at all. Or should I say, insulting the people is not a good practice from the start.

## 2. The separation and stand out from the Gacha Life/Gacha Club community (Timeline: 2022 - 2024 - Project osu! Mg 2.0 - 5.0)
I really can't stand the Gacha Life/Gacha Club community. With too many cringe contents, it's a very big sign that this community is brain rotted. But if I throw away my character that I created on my own the use anime girls like so, it's really useless for me, and I don't like that. That's why I start this project, and keep this project to be alive. Even after Hikari-chan doesn't play osu! anymore, I still try to hold and lead the project. 20k, 10k, 5k, and now 3.7k ranks. During this time, there was a drama, the kids from the Gacha Life 2 community accused me of being homophobic because I didn't join the LGBT woke with those guys and chose to be straight, which happened in April 2024. That's when I decided [to stop supporting the community](https://catboy.school/p/dxh9t2o723). The project will be from now on, independent from the community.

## 3. The insults will continue more, and more.
Just this year in Osekai Medal Hunters, tortori made an insulting statement about the ball collaboration. That night, I also announced that I entered the 3.9k rank in the chat, and also received 2 insults. Perhaps, this kind of mindset will continue in a long time. It's a correct time to expose this action.

## 4. To reiterate, project osu! Gacha Club:
- Always say **no** to Gacha Life. (Gacha Club is Gacha Club, there is no Gacha Life at all, but maybe if I and Hikari-chan have an agreement, or there is a request from Hikari-chan, then in later version, we might introduce the presence of characters made from Gacha Life 2)
- **Never** get involved or affiliated with Gacha Life/Gacha Club Community.
- **Never** promotes cringe, heat, 18+ contents.
- **Never** allows people under 13 to use the project.
- Is a serious project to rewrite the definition of Gacha Club in osu!, that the usage is never bad when using correctly, and will always continue to develop to be strong enough to "slap" those who have grudges against or attempt to insult this project.
- Will publicly expose the insults in this hall of shame.
