#                                 ~ Important ~
                                 
âš  **The Project (along with big project - osu! Gacha Club) no longer affiliates and no longer supports Gacha Community anymore, starting from 15th May, 2024**. That doesn't mean I stopped supporting the game, but please DO NOT refer this as a part of Gacha Community anymore. We simply do it for personal use at the start, and I bring this part of project for public use to everyone who supported us, not for serving and beautify Gacha Community anymore like it used to be.

Update on 24/03/2025 from Mg (me): I might re-consider supporting the community after the below community has done something worse to me, should the community choose to and welcome me and this project back

âš  **The Project (along with big project - osu! Gacha Club) also no longer affiliates and no longer supports RGVN, starting from 20th March, 2025. Their defamation behind my back has disgusted me.** Should they continue to consume this project to defame members of the project and caught red-handed, I'll file a lawsuit.

âš  **We DO NOT welcome member of RGVN (except explicit cases), Gacha players and other players who are woke LGBTQ+ (or should I say, the predators), and Gacha Kids (Gacha Players who are less than 14 years old).** If you are like that, and you wanna call me homophobic and disgusting guy, go on, I don't care. As stated, this project is only for the one who wish to sail on same boat with me and support me.

âœ³ For 4.2.x: The skin is only SD-based, HD elements will be reworked once I have plenty of time to do
