#                                 ~ Important ~
                                 
⚠ **The Project (along with big project - osu! Gacha Club) IS NOT a part of Gacha Community.** That does not mean I stopped supporting the game. We simply do it for personal use at the start, and I bring this part of project for public use to everyone who supported us, not for serving and beautify Gacha Community like in the past. [Read here to understand why](https://github.com/greenmg2003/osu-mg-reload/blob/main/project_direction.md). All the hatred that I received that is like "Ew Gacha" or "Gacha is disgusting" will be redirected to community, I do not have time to deal with that. The community does bad thing and they must suffer the consequences themselves, not me.

⚠ **We DO NOT welcome kids from Gacha Community who are 16 years old and below, or cringe, heat content creators.** As stated, this project is only for the one who wish to sail on same boat with me and support me.
