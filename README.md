#                                 ~ Important ~
                                
~‚ö† The Project (along with big project - osu! Gacha Club) no longer affiliates and no longer supports Gacha Community anymore, starting from 15th May, 2024, until the end of 14th April 2025. That doesn't mean I stopped supporting the game, but please DO NOT refer this as a part of Gacha Community anymore. We simply do it for personal use at the start, and I bring this part of project for public use to everyone who supported us, not for serving and beautify Gacha Community anymore like it used to be.~ (This statement is subjected to be changed later)

Update on 24/03/2025 from Mg (me): I might re-consider supporting the community after the below community has done something worse to me, should the community choose to and welcome me and this project back

Update on 14/04/2025 from Mg (me): With the release of Gacha Story coming in 15/04/2025, I'll give the community the second chance to test

‚ö† **The Project (along with big project - osu! Gacha Club) also no longer affiliates and no longer supports RGVN, starting from 20th March, 2025. Their defamation behind my back has disgusted me.** Should they continue to consume this project to defame members of the project and caught red-handed, I'll file a lawsuit.

‚ö† **We DO NOT welcome member of RGVN (except explicit cases), Gacha players and other players who are woke LGBTQ+ (or should I say, the predators), and Gacha Kids (Gacha Players who are less than 14 years old).** If you are like that, and you wanna call me homophobic and disgusting guy, go on, I don't care. As stated, this project is only for the one who wish to sail on same boat with me and support me.

‚ú≥ For 4.1.x: The skin is only SD-based, HD elements will be reworked once I have plenty of time to do
