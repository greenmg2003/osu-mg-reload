# Direction of the project

**After asking several times from many people on the opinion of putting faith of Gacha Life/Gacha Club/Gacha Life 2 communities, and directly asking co-owner of the project, @hikari2006, my answer is a no. We are fully against Gacha Life/Gacha Club/Gacha Life 2 communites, and this project will continue to grow on itself without the communities. I will explain briefly why I choose to stand <ins>against</ins> the communities, right here.**

So, just yesterday (7th June, 2025), I read back on [the post in r/GachaClubCringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GachaClubCringe/comments/1l2crtw/why_are_almost_all_of_the_new_gacha_lifeclub_mini/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and I really realized one thing. Like, apparently, more than 80% or more content from Gacha Life, Gacha Club, Gacha Life 2 communities (Gacha Communities for short) are some MM about dramatic romantic stuff and some weird shipping, reaction videos. Not only that, a lot of cringe, low-effort content, cringe TikTok trend has also struck the communities so much, and the worse is the existence of people like Bella The Wolf, LenTotally, etc..., that devastate the whole communities. And for short, the sum of content from the communities is just, too much cringe and very few decent arts/beautiful, original-idea videos/contents are created. Especially the kids touching Gacha Life/Gacha Club are now too much. 

Not only that, I do have to mention the root cause of the community, the children doing a lot of **heat and NSFW contents**, and the outsiders, or even people in the community thought this game is cringe and disgusting, only solely for making immature contents or low-effort contents. **The community knew, yet what did they do? Nothing.** Just a very few- No, not a single education lesson is provided, and that's it. The reputation of the game is much very bad to the whole.

([Here is one of the examples. There are more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GachaClubCringe/comments/1lsuq1o/heavy_heavy_tw_rpe_its_sick_its_just_sick/))

For me, I am **extremely disappointed** that the communities just got worse and worse, repetitive content. Even worse, it's the _only way_ for Gacha Life/Gacha Club creators to grow fame on YouTube and TikTok. Sure, just hundreds video of this and it'll be still fine and good quality, but thousands of videos with same plot in 20 - 22 minute, it's just... So bad and boring, that you even knew where it goes. Even worse, the promotion of NSFW content, especially Gacha Heat content, is enormously disturbing and damaging creators that are not related to community but still create astonishing masterpieces.

There are, of course, some opinions that has been voiced about this concern. But in sum, majority of them turned the green light of me not putting the faith into the communities. The team member, along with the project, will reject any forms of using this project to "beautify the community". We have decided to continue standing outside of the communities, and therefore, all the hates about this project having Gacha Club in it will continue to be redirected to the communities, we are not responsible for this. 

Update on the situation, we are against the Gacha Comminties as a whole, and this action is widely accepted in some other communities. While we use Gacha Club for our project as the core, we are completely **against the community**. The kids in the communities, especially at the 13 - 16 years old, will take more hatred, and **that is deserved** for being a part of this damn communities, like what I used to suffer.

Of course, I will only protect the people who has supported the project. After all, the purpose is achieved, and I can sit back and relax. Version 5.1.0 might come later, but only after I have polished everything. Maybe that's all thing I need to say.
