# Direction of the project

**After asking several times from many people on the opinion of putting faith of Gacha Life/Gacha Club/Gacha Life 2 community, my answer is a no. This project will continue to grow on itself without the community. I will explain briefly why I choose to stand <ins>against</ins> the community, right here.**

So, just yesterday (7th June, 2025), I read back on [the post in r/GachaClubCringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GachaClubCringe/comments/1l2crtw/why_are_almost_all_of_the_new_gacha_lifeclub_mini/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and I really realized one thing. Like, apparently, more than 80% or more content from Gacha Life, Gacha Club, Gacha Life 2 communities are some MM about dramatic romantic stuff and some weird shipping, reaction videos. Not only that, a lot of cringe, low-effort content, cringe TikTok trend has also struck the community so much, and the worse is the existence of people like Bella The Wolf, LenTotally, etc..., that devastate the whole community. And for short, the sum of content from the community is just, too much cringe and very few decent arts/beautiful, original-idea videos/contents are created. Especially the kids touching Gacha Life/Gacha Club are now too much tho. 

For me, I am **extremely disappointed** that the community just got worse and worse, repetitive content. Even worse, it's the _only way_ for Gacha Life/Gacha Club creators to grow fame on YouTube and TikTok. Sure, just hundreds video of this and it'll be still fine and good quality, but thousands of videos with same plot in 20 - 22 minute, it's just... So bad and boring, that you knew where it goes.

There are, of course, some opinions that has been voiced about this concern. But in sum, they turned the green light of me not putting the faith into the community. The team member, along with the project, will reject any forms of using this project to "beautify the community". We have decided to continue standing outside of the community, and therefore, all the hates about this project having Gacha Club in it will continue be redirected to the community. 

Of course, I will only protect the people who has supported the project. After all, the purpose is achieved, and I can sit back and relax. Version 5.1.0 might come later, but only after I have polished everything.Maybe that's all thing I need to say.
