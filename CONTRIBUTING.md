# Rules and guildlines for contributing and making discussion

## 1. No toxic towards Gacha Club elements, and feel free to speak out your idea!

\+ If you use my skin and want to help me grow my skin, please reduce your hatred towars Gacha elements on my skin down to 0. It's acceptable if you don't like it without leaving any toxic comment.

\+ You can open issues if you want to start contributing my project. Suggestions are opened too. Also pull requests are open to everyone too! (Don't know how? Check 6th section of this file)

## 2. Don't refer the project as a part of Gacha Community

\+ Starting from May 15th, the project no longer affiliates with Gacha Community, so every toxic comment that violates 1st rule will be redirected to Gacha Community. I am no longer protecting that crappy community

\+ However, please do not attack the one who supported my project all along, they are not deserved to be harrashed.

\+ Update on May 25th 2025: I might consider this again, should the community choose to improve and welcome me to join them

## 3. Feel like you are at home with us!

\+ If you feel down, or you have issues in your life, feel free to open up discussions to share with us about what you are struggling. We will try our best to cover you!

\+ If you feel happy, wanna share something you enjoy best in your life, keep in mind that we are also open to hear too!

\+ If you feel shy or you are willing to contribute our project but you are not brave enough, it's okay, we know that people have limits to express something

## 4. Follow osu! rules

\+ It's necessary to follow the osu! rules too. You can check here: https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules

## 5. Behaviours have to be good (Rules from Alpha Green Mg's palace)

\+ Remember that swearing is allowed, but it's limited to swearing in friendly, joking zone without insulting people and subjects. Anyone who insults the members will be punished.

\+ _Avoid ruining the mood of the others_

\+ NSFW things are not allowed, sorry (Due to GitHub's rules, if it's allowed, then I'll update here later)

\+ Unity is the first, so fun short drama is allowed, but, please avoid serious + toxic drama and sensitive topic.

\+ Keep members' personal details as private.

\+ Toxic behaviour, bragging at any kind will be resulted in a lock from chatting in discussion, so please consider thinking **twice** before acting

\+ Avoid spamming too much or members in the chat will be in chaos. (Yes, I'm serious that you can spam to express what you wanna say, I allowed, but please avoid ruining mood of others just because of your spam)
