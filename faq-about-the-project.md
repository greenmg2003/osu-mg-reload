osu! Gacha Club is at its stable state. You might be wondering, why did I use Gacha Club for this project, knowing the Gacha Community is toxic and cringe, or why did I take such a dangerous path that people hates to do so. I think this will be a perfect opportunity to answer questions that might be frequently asked, as well as giving you an advice.

# 1. When did you start the project? What was challenging for you thing back then? 
I started this project back in 2020, maybe October or November. At first, osu! Gacha Club project was not like what you're looking nowadays. Back then, it was made by @hikari2006 (Hikari Richiumu, co-leader of this project). Our project target at first was to bring our character designed in Gacha Club to osu! and implement the skin that we learnt from WhiteCat, Vaxei, or even chocomint.
When it was a success, Hikari taught me how to make the skin on my own, and so, osu! Mg was born, started with 1.0.0 (I lost my file back then...). That time, it was not looking good, it looked like this (Used opsu! to play)

Or maybe, some files look like this

Then, I learnt from myself and advices on how to improve, redesigned my skin, and yup, you can see it from the preview of each branch. Here's what it looks now (Taken picture with version 5.0.2):

The challenge thing back then was that, I got litte support and received a lot of hatred. Just look at [this file](https://github.com/greenmg2003/osu-mg-reload/blob/main/30-01-2025-serious-report.md), you can get what I mean. However, I made many friends who welcomes me to be part of them, and also support this project, set sail with me. As of now, every constructive suggestion means a lot to me, really.

# 2. Why did you choose Gacha Club as a core of the project? Isn't it Gacha Life? I heard that the community related to that is cringe.
Some of you might wonder so. Letme explain, the character I made on this skin are 100% from Gacha Club. Gacha Club is very different from Gacha Life, although both are developed by same creator. Gacha Club is way fresher, and it lets me choose how I can design myself easily. Pose is really limited compared to Gacha Life 2, but I'm fine with it.
To simply put, Gacha Club isn't Gacha Life, and so are the characters. The community is cringe, yep, I can't deny, but as of 15th May, 2024, my project is not affiliated with the community anymore, so it should be good to go. Keep in mind, this project does not contain any cringe elements like cringe people in that community.
# 3. Can I use this skin and make suggestion on this project?
You are very free to do, so go ahead and use it, I'm glad! If you want to make suggestion and/or making pull request to contribute to this project, I'm very glad as well, just make sure you read [this guideline](https://github.com/greenmg2003/osu-mg-reload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing!
# 4. My advice from this project
