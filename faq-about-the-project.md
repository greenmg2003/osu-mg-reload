You might be wondering, why did I use Gacha Club for this project, knowing the Gacha Community is toxic and cringe, or why did I take such a dangerous path that people hates to do so. I think this will be a perfect opportunity to answer questions that might be frequently asked, as well as giving you an advice.

# 1. When did you start the project? What was challenging thing back then? 
# 2. Why did you choose Gacha Club as a core of the project? Isn't it Gacha Life? I heard that the community related to that is cringe.

# 4. My advice from this project
